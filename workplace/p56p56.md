> If interpretation functions as a median cut that traverses the length of the strip, transforming it from a unilateral surface to a bilateral surface, the result would be a return to the Saussurean sign (the two-sided unit) and the restoration of meaning, the binding of signifier to signified.

如果解释的作用就相当于横穿条带的中间切线，将其从单面转换为双边面，那么结果将是返回到索绪尔的指号(两边一体)上，意义也一并恢复，即能指与所指的绑定。

> At this point we should introduce metonymy, the formula of which Lacan provided in ‘The Instance of the Letter’ <sup>64</sup>:

在这一点上，我们应该引入转喻，拉康在“信的实例”<sup>64</sup>中提供了这个公式：

> I have simply added the relevant letters to Dylan Evans’ concise definition of this formula: 

我只是在迪伦·埃文斯对这个公式的简明定义中添加了相关的字母：

$f(S…S’)S≅S(—)s$

> “the signifying function [f] of the connection of the signifier with the signifier [(S … S′)] is congruent with [≅] the maintenance of the bar [—] between signifier [S] and signified [s].”<sup>65</sup> 

“意指函数$f$表示能指与能指之间的连接$(S…S’)$，它就约等于在能指与所指之间建立联系$S(—)s$<sup>65</sup>。“

> Metonymy (as the diachronic linking of signifiers in a chain) endlessly defers the meaning effect; the subject can never “say it all” or, indeed, say it, there are always more (suitable) signifiers, more (suitable) combinations, the totalisation of meaning or the realisation of unitary and unambiguous meaning eludes him.

转喻(如连词链中的历时连接)无休止地推迟了意义效果；主语永远不能“说出一切”，或者说，总有更多(合适的)能指、更多(合适)的词组——综合化的或统一而明确的意义仿佛在躲避着他。

> What awaits the subject on the ‘other side’ of the Möbius strip is not the signified of one signifier (S or “a man”) but just another signifier (S′or “a man”). 

在莫比乌斯地带的“另一边”等待着的不是一个能指(S或“a man”)的所指，而是另一个能指(S‘或“a man”)。

> The crossing of the bar from one side to the other has been illusory: whereas from a local perspective the Möbius strip appears to have two sides, from a global perspective—a perspective acquired once the signifying circuit of anticipation-retroaction has been completed—it has only one. 

从一边到另一边的横越是虚幻的：从局部的角度来看，这环条带似乎有两面，但从全局的角度看——一旦预期的意指回路——回溯，已经完成——莫比乌斯带只有一个面。

> The bar, as the edge of the Möbius strip, does not separate two distinct sides (as it does as the edge of Saussure’s bilateral piece of paper), it instead, as the single edge of a single surface, separates this surface from a void. 

此公式中的横杠，作为莫比乌斯环的边缘，并没有分开两个截然不同的边(像索绪尔的双面纸的边一样)，相反，它作为单个表面的单一边缘，将这个表面与一个空洞分开。

> The bar thus becomes a “real edge”<sup>66</sup>—real in the sense that it is impossible to defeat. 

因此，横杠变成了一个“真正的边缘”<sup>66</sup>——真正的意义上，它是不可能被打败的。

> Indeed, insofar as the signifying articulation qua cut is a line without points equivalent to this edge of the strip, 

事实上，就所指的清晰度而言，准切线是一条没有与带的这条边相等的点的线

> “the connection of the signifier with the signifier” is not just “congruent with the maintenance of the bar,” it is a pure instantiation of the bar, . The line-without-points is a quantitative reduction of language’s infinite potential (the lines-without-points) that nonetheless retains the qualitative “real-of-the-structure” of this Möbian surface. 

——“能指与能指的连接”不仅仅是约等于“与能指与所指之间的横杠”，它是横杠的纯粹实例化，是横杠的“转世化身”。线-无点是语言无限潜能(线-无点)的定量约简，但保留了这个莫比安表面的定性“真实结构”。

> This, then, is the true other side of the signifier: the void that the cut of the signifier creates. The effet de signifié of the divided subject’s verbalised presentation of himself is a gap, an effect that emerges from the combination of signifiers (the inability of signifiers to signify themselves) but nonetheless remains beyond these signifiers.

> As noted, a further consequence of this cut is to produce a bilateral strip—but, unlike the Saussurean model, this surface offers only signifiers that are to be read by the psychoanalyst as detached from any supposed meaning effect. 

> The smooth continuity of the Möbian surface—that is, the signifying chain producing either the impression of a meaning effect (metaphor) or the promise of a meaning effect that is interminably deferred (metonymy)—is subverted so that signifiers are cut from another. 

> No longer occupying the same surface, the signifiers are to be considered not only in their detachment from any meaning effect but also in their detachment from the combinations that create such effects. 

> As Lacan put it, the analyst works with “a fragmented signifying chain [and] its interpretable elements.”<sup>67</sup> 

> Noting Lacan’s insistence that “there would not be metaphor if it weren’t for metonymy”<sup>68</sup> because “metaphor requires a signifying chain (something in which a bar between signifier and signified is established and maintained) in order to create the effect of a crossing of the bar,” and that, in any case, metaphor is itself based upon a combination of signifiers that produces a signified effect that exceeds these signifiers—poetic metaphor, for example, inspires interpretation and inquiry rather than establishing unequivocal meaning—Pluth argues that in both metonymy and metaphor what actually lurks on the ‘other side’ of the Möbius strip is always another signifier.<sup>69</sup> 

> This is doubtless why, in ‘Radiophonie’, Lacan follows a summary of these two mechanisms with a dense outline of a single mode of interpretation; “the interpretative cut”:

> For it is only from this cut that this surface, where from every point one has access to its reverse side, without having to pass over an edge (thus it has a single surface), is seen afterwards provided with a recto and a verso. 

> The Freudian double inscription thus would not spring from any Saussurean barrier, but from the practice itself that poses the question of it namely the cut from which the unconscious in desisting testifies to have only consisted of the cut, that is, the more discourse is interpreted, the more it confirms itself to be unconscious. 
To the point that only psychoanalysis would discover that there is a reverse [envers] side to the discourse—on the condition of interpreting it.<sup>70</sup>
