The question that should be asked, however, is whether topology sur￾passes the relative banality of an efficiency saving and is superior to lan￾guage per se; that is, no matter how compact or voluminous. Certain 
of Lacan’s statements seem to suggest that topology retains a suitability 
that makes it not merely a more refined version of what has already been 
formulated in language: there is “a very particular mode of the subject 
for which the only index I have found is topological.”32 In Seminar XIII
Lacan pulls back slightly by offering topology as an aid to “establish￾ing fundamental relationships … with a rigour which has never been 
obtained up to now in ordinary language.”33 The gap between these two 
positions is not insurmountable. Lacan’s aphorisms—as the results of an 
effort to attain a rigour through ordinary language—always convey or, at 
the very least, imply, a topology. Statements such as “a signifier is what 
represents a subject to another signifier” or “the desire of the subject is the 
desire of the Other” refer to non-Euclidean “fundamental relationships” 
between terms—a topology, in other words. In this respect, not only is 
topology not a “supplementary complexity,” it is not a supplement at all 
since it is primary to language, it is the set of fundamental relationships 
that Lacan’s language, as a supplementary complexity or simplification 
(depending on one’s point of view), re-presents. Therefore, if one only 
asks (as many sceptical critics do) “what is the value of the topological 
supplement to Lacan’s renovation of the foundations of psychoanalytic 
thought” or “what does topology add to Lacan’s presentation,” one risks 
missing the point entirely which is that Freud’s discovery of the subject 
of the unconscious was the discovery of fundamental relationships that 
cannot be established geometrically. Lacan’s response was to firm up or 
illuminate those relationships that Freud’s work conveyed or implied, 
establish additional relationships and ask how an analyst should proceed 
in “the topology of our experience.”34
Indeed, it is perhaps the economic benefit that is most uncertain since 
Lacan’s topology requires explanation. As he admits, while “[m]athemati￾cal formalisation is our goal,” this same writing “only subsists if I employ, 
in presenting it, the language I make use of. Therein lies the objection: no 
formalisation of language is transmissible without language itself.”35 Must 
“metaphorical meanings” return to rescue topology from a mute obscu￾rity? If, accepting here the argument that topology is a supplementary
