> If interpretation functions as a median cut that traverses the length of the strip, transforming it from a unilateral surface to a bilateral surface, the result would be a return to the Saussurean sign (the two-sided unit) and the restoration of meaning, the binding of signifier to signified.

> At this point we should introduce metonymy, the formula of which Lacan provided in ‘The Instance of the Letter’ <sup>64</sup>:

> I have simply added the relevant letters to Dylan Evans’ concise definition of this formula: 

$f(S…S’)S≅S(—)s$

> “the signifying function [f] of the connection of the signifier with the signifier [(S … S′)] is congruent with [≅] the maintenance of the bar [—] between signifier [S] and signified [s].”<sup>65</sup> 

> Metonymy (as the diachronic linking of signifiers in a chain) endlessly defers the meaning effect; the subject can never “say it all” or, indeed, say it, there are always more (suitable) signifiers, more (suitable) combinations, the totalisation of meaning or the realisation of unitary and unambiguous meaning eludes him.

> What awaits the subject on the ‘other side’ of the Möbius strip is not the signified of one signifier (S or “a man”) but just another signifier (S′or “a man”). 

> The crossing of the bar from one side to the other has been illusory: whereas from a local perspective the Möbius strip appears to have two sides, from a global perspective—a perspective acquired once the signifying circuit of anticipation-retroaction has been completed—it has only one. 

> The bar, as the edge of the Möbius strip, does not separate two distinct sides (as it does as the edge of Saussure’s bilateral piece of paper), it instead, as the single edge of a single surface, separates this surface from a void. 

> The bar thus becomes a “real edge”<sup>66</sup>—real in the sense that it is impossible to defeat. 

> Indeed, insofar as the signifying articulation qua cut is a line without points equivalent to this edge of the strip, 

> “the connection of the signifier with the signifier” is not just “congruent with the maintenance of the bar,” it is a pure instantiation of the bar, the bar incarnate. The line-without-points is a quantitative reduction of language’s infinite potential (the lines-without-points) that nonetheless retains the qualitative “real-of-the-structure” of this Möbian surface. 

> This, then, is the true other side of the signifier: the void that the cut of the signifier creates. The effet de signifié of the divided subject’s verbalised presentation of himself is a gap, an effect that emerges from the combination of signifiers (the inability of signifiers to signify themselves) but nonetheless remains beyond these signifiers.

> As noted, a further consequence of this cut is to produce a bilateral strip—but, unlike the Saussurean model, this surface offers only signifiers that are to be read by the psychoanalyst as detached from any supposed meaning effect. 

> The smooth continuity of the Möbian surface—that is, the signifying chain producing either the impression of a meaning effect (metaphor) or the promise of a meaning effect that is interminably deferred (metonymy)—is subverted so that signifiers are cut from another. 

> No longer occupying the same surface, the signifiers are to be considered not only in their detachment from any meaning effect but also in their detachment from the combinations that create such effects. 

> As Lacan put it, the analyst works with “a fragmented signifying chain [and] its interpretable elements.”<sup>67</sup> 

> Noting Lacan’s insistence that “there would not be metaphor if it weren’t for metonymy”<sup>68</sup> because “metaphor requires a signifying chain (something in which a bar between signifier and signified is established and maintained) in order to create the effect of a crossing of the bar,” and that, in any case, metaphor is itself based upon a combination of signifiers that produces a signified effect that exceeds these signifiers—poetic metaphor, for example, inspires interpretation and inquiry rather than establishing unequivocal meaning—Pluth argues that in both metonymy and metaphor what actually lurks on the ‘other side’ of the Möbius strip is always another signifier.<sup>69</sup> 

> This is doubtless why, in ‘Radiophonie’, Lacan follows a summary of these two mechanisms with a dense outline of a single mode of interpretation; “the interpretative cut”:

> For it is only from this cut that this surface, where from every point one has access to its reverse side, without having to pass over an edge (thus it has a single surface), is seen afterwards provided with a recto and a verso. 

> The Freudian double inscription thus would not spring from any Saussurean barrier, but from the practice itself that poses the question of it namely the cut from which the unconscious in desisting testifies to have only consisted of the cut, that is, the more discourse is interpreted, the more it confirms itself to be unconscious. 
To the point that only psychoanalysis would discover that there is a reverse [envers] side to the discourse—on the condition of interpreting it.<sup>70</sup>
